# E-Commerce Cart App

This is a simple e-commerce cart application built using React.js, Material UI, and localStorage for persistence. The app allows users to add, update, and remove items from their shopping cart.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Display products with images, titles, and prices.
- **Add to Cart**: Add products to the shopping cart.
- **Cart Management**: Update product quantities, remove items, and view the total price.
- **Persistence**: Cart items are saved in `localStorage` to retain cart data between page reloads.
- **Responsive**: The app is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Material UI
- `localStorage` for cart persistence
- React Router for routing (if applicable)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version)
- npm or yarn (for managing dependencies)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-cart-app.git
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd ecommerce-cart-app
Install dependencies:

If you're using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Or, if you're using yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn install
Running the Application
To start the development server and run the app locally:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Or, if you're using yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn start
Your app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Build for Production
To create a production-ready build of the app:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will generate the optimized files in the build folder, which you can deploy to your preferred hosting provider.

Features & Usage
1. Product Dashboard
Displays a list of available products.
Each product has an image, title, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
2. Cart
View the products you've added to your cart.
Increase or decrease the quantity of each product (at least 1 item should remain in the cart).
Delete a product from the cart.
The cart is stored in localStorage to persist data across page refreshes.
The total price of all items in the cart is displayed at the bottom.
File Structure
bash
Copy code
/src
  /components
    /Cart.js           # Cart page where users can manage their items
    /ProductList.js    # Product listing page
  /hooks
    /useCart.js        # Custom hook to manage cart state and persistence
  /App.js              # Main App component with routing (if applicable)
  /index.js            # React entry point for rendering the app
/public
  /index.html          # The main HTML file
  /assets              # Folder to store static assets like images
How Cart Persistence Works
The cart data is saved to localStorage whenever an item is added, removed, or updated. This allows users to refresh the page without losing their cart items.
The cart data is loaded from localStorage when the app is first loaded to restore the state.
